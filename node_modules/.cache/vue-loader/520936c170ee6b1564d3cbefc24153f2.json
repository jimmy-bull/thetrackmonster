Licensor will have an online\n      account with Licensee known as the “Dashboard.” The Dashboard enables\n      Licensor to see its activities with Licensee Partners. The right to:\n      perform the Content in streaming format on Licensee’s website or other\n      websites owned and/or controlled by Licensee Partners; publicly display\n      and make available for download as part of the sale of the Masters, the\n      lyrics of the Compositions; collect monies for the playing of the Masters\n      on non-interactive webcasts and streaming of the Masters (payable by\n      SoundExchange in the USA). This collection right is only for Licensor’s\n      Masters. Any monies collected on behalf of Licensor for webcasts or\n      streams are included in “Revenue” (defined below) and are subject to the\n      payment provisions of this Agreement; with prior written approval from\n      Licensor, include the Content in audio and/or audiovisual compilation(s)\n      for sale via physical distribution, and in such cases, to manufacture,\n      make copies of, distribute, and sell physical embodiments of the Content;\n      release, advertise, and sell electronic files or equivalent electronic\n      form(s) of the Content and to permit others to do so under the trademark\n      “BeatStars” or under any trademark used by Licensee; sub-license the\n      rights granted by Licensor to Licensee in this Agreement as necessary to\n      Licensee Partners, solely to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement\n      including but not limited to those rights necessary to promote, market,\n      advertise, distribute and sell the Content to consumers. Licensee’s grant\n      of rights to Licensee Partners for use of the Content shall always be\n      subject to the terms and limitations of this Agreement. 4) Promotional &\n      Other Rights Unless otherwise instructed in writing by Licensor, Licensee\n      shall have the non-exclusive right, in its sole discretion and in line\n      with customary practices, to market the Masters and other Content as\n      applicable, for promotional purposes and without compensation to Licensor.\n      In order for Licensee to provide marketing and licensing services under\n      this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee the right to: publicly perform\n      the Masters (and other Content as applicable) on Licensee’s websites and\n      permit Licensee Partners to publicly perform the Masters on their\n      website(s) on a gratis basis for the purposes of promoting the sale of the\n      Content. Licensor hereby acknowledges that Licensee and Licensee Partners\n      shall be exempt from any payments of performance royalties otherwise due\n      to owners of sound recordings for digital performances of the same if the\n      use is for promotional purposes. Licensee shall require Licensee Partners\n      to pay any public performance royalties which may be due to\n      publishers/writers of the Compositions for promotional uses of the\n      Compositions; include the Masters in one or more streaming electronic\n      radio formats to promote and market the Masters; print, publish,\n      disseminate, and otherwise use and permit others to use the “NIL\n      Materials” (defined below) for the purposes of trade, advertising, and\n      other exploitations solely in connection with the marketing, sale, and\n      exploitation of the Content. The “NIL Materials” are defined as the\n      approved likeness, approved biography, approved photos, and other approved\n      promotional material provided by Licensor, including the name, both legal\n      and professional, whether presently or hereafter used by Licensor, and\n      name(s) of others whose work is embodied on the Content including the\n      “Performer” (as defined below). All NIL Materials provided by Licensor to\n      Licensee shall be deemed approved. All material provided by Licensor to\n      Licensee may be edited to fit the format of the specific use without\n      further approval from Licensor. Licensee shall have the right to permit\n      Licensee Partners, successors and designees the right to use the approved\n      NIL Materials as outlined in this subparagraph. “Performer(s)” as used in\n      this Agreement means any person whose musical, vocal or production\n      services are embodied on the Content. 5) Payment Licensee shall pay\n      Licensor the percentages of “Revenue” as outlined on Revenue Shares in\n      Appendix A of this Agreement and forming a part of it. “Revenue” means\n      income actually received by or credited to Licensee that is derived solely\n      from the exploitation of the Content less mechanical royalties, if any.\n      Income received by Licensee may be subject to taxes, surcharges or fees\n      imposed by government agencies or Licensee Partners before payment is sent\n      to Licensee. Licensee shall have no obligation to pay Licensor Revenue\n      which Licensee has not actually received until such time as Licensee\n      receives such Revenue. In certain emerging digital media markets (“New\n      Territories”), Licensee has entered into an agreement with one or more\n      Licensee Partner(s) to manage the distribution and appropriate marketing\n      of the Content in that specific New Territory. As such these particular\n      Licensee Partners retain a higher percentage of the income from the\n      distribution, marketing and sales of the Content than is typically\n      maintained in developed digital media markets prior to paying Licensee.\n      Licensor shall always have the option to withhold or withdraw Content from\n      New Territories. Revenue shall be paid monthly on the 15th of each month\n      or the following business day if such date occurs on a weekend or holiday.\n      Each payment will be accompanied by a detailed statement showing all sales\n      and other Revenue-generating exploitations of the Content. If Licensor has\n      not received payment or a statement indicating that no payment is due by\n      the 20th day of the month, Licensor shall promptly advise Licensee that\n      Licensor has not received payment or a statement. Licensee shall\n      investigate the situation and assure that payment and/or a statement are\n      sent to Licensor. In no event shall Licensee be deemed in breach of its\n      payment obligations under this Agreement if Licensor has not received\n      payment or a statement on the 15th of the month. However, Licensee may be\n      deemed in breach of its payment obligations if Licensee fails to make\n      payments or provide a statement thirty (30) days after receiving notice\n      from Licensor as outlined above. No payment shall be made to Licensor in\n      any month when less than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) is due and\n      payable to Licensor via paper check or Paypal. In the event payment is not\n      made to Licensor for this reason, such amounts below one hundred fifty\n      U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable, will accrue to Licensor’s account and\n      shall be paid in the first month in which Licensor’s account reflects a\n      balance greater than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable.\n      All payments to Licensor from Licensee under this Agreement shall be made\n      via paper check or Paypal. Licensor hereby acknowledges that in the United\n      States among the ways that mechanical royalties for digital sales are\n      customarily paid include: (i) payment directly to the publishers/writers\n      by the music services/retailers, and (ii) an all-in payment as part of the\n      fee paid by the music services/retailers to Licensee and are not paid\n      separately to the publishers/writers of compositions. In those instances\n      when Licensee receives what is considered the mechanical royalty as part\n      of the fee from Licensee Partners, the portion deemed the mechanical\n      payment shall be included in Revenue paid to Licensor. Licensor shall be\n      fully and solely responsible for paying the mechanical royalty to the\n      appropriate publishers/writers for use of the Compositions under this\n      Agreement. 6) Accountings & Audits All statements shall be binding upon\n      Licensor and not subject to objection by Licensor unless specific\n      objection in writing, stating the basis thereof, is given to Licensee\n      within two (2) years from the date the statement is rendered, viewed,\n      and/or downloaded. Licensor shall have two (2) years from the date each\n      statement is rendered, viewed and/or downloaded to conduct an inspection\n      of Licensee’s books and records specifically relating to Licensor’s sales\n      and payment activity. Such inspection shall take place at the location\n      where Licensee normally keeps such books and records and shall be\n      conducted during normal business hours. All such inspections shall be made\n      upon prior written notice to Licensee at least thirty (30) days prior to\n      the date Licensor intends to conduct such inspection. Licensor may only\n      inspect records relating to each statement once and may only conduct such\n      an inspection once a year. Licensee shall have the absolute right in\n      accounting to Licensor to rely upon the statements received by Licensee\n      from third parties and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for\n      any error, omission, or other inaccuracy of any such statement(s) or\n      information received by Licensee. However, if Licensee knows or has a\n      reliable business reason to know of an error, omission or other inaccuracy\n      in such third party statement or information, Licensee shall promptly act\n      to correct it and when corrected, Licensee shall appropriately correct\n      Licensor’s statement and Revenue. 7) Confidentiality Licensee and Licensor\n      shall keep the terms and conditions of this Agreement confidential both\n      during the Term and thereafter, and shall not disclose any information\n      concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement to any other person\n      or entity. Each party may refer generally to the existence of this\n      Agreement but shall not reveal the terms of this Agreement, including but\n      not limited to the payment provisions, other confidential information,\n      proprietary information, business plans, business models, customers,\n      clients, technology, products, or any other information which either party\n      identifies as confidential (collectively, the “Confidential Information”)\n      without the prior written consent of the other party. Either party may\n      disclose the Confidential Information on a “need to know” basis to its\n      attorneys, financial, and other advisors who are under a duty of\n      confidentiality to the disclosing party without the prior written consent\n      of the other party so long as those agents are informed of this\n      Confidentiality provision and agree to be bound by it and maintain the\n      Confidential Information confidential. If required by law or governmental\n      regulation, either party may disclose the Confidential Information only\n      after it provides the other party with notice of the potential disclosure\n      and the other party has the opportunity to narrow the information to be\n      disclosed or dispute the disclosure. Nothing in this provision shall\n      prohibit either party from disclosing that an agreement exists between\n      Licensor and Licensee so long as the terms and conditions of this\n      Agreement are not disclosed. 8) Representations and Warranties A.\n      Licensor’s representations and warranties. Licensor warrants, represents,\n      and agrees that: unless otherwise noted, Licensor possesses all rights in\n      and to the Content to enable Licensee to use the Content as contemplated\n      in this Agreement.

Licensor explicitly warrants and represents that: the Content\n      contains NO unauthorized “Samples.” “Samples” as used herein means any\n      portion(s) or interpolation(s) of third party master recording(s) and/or\n      composition(s), video(s) and/or other material(s), or portions thereof\n      whether musical, lyrical or otherwise, not owned and/or controlled by\n      Licensor.
