      Licensor hereby licenses the Content to Licensee for distribution and
      exploitation as follows: The non-exclusive electronic, digital, and mobile
      rights in the Content to create digital and/or electronic copies and
      compilations, to distribute, to sell, and to publicly perform the Content
      via all electronic, digital, and mobile platforms owned and/or controlled
      by third parties with whom Licensee has or enters into agreements with
      during the Term (“Licensee Partners”). Licensor will have an online
      account with Licensee known as the “Dashboard.” The Dashboard enables
      Licensor to see its activities with Licensee Partners. The right to:
      perform the Content in streaming format on Licensee’s website or other
      websites owned and/or controlled by Licensee Partners; publicly display
      and make available for download as part of the sale of the Masters, the
      lyrics of the Compositions; collect monies for the playing of the Masters
      on non-interactive webcasts and streaming of the Masters (payable by
      SoundExchange in the USA). This collection right is only for Licensor’s
      Masters. Any monies collected on behalf of Licensor for webcasts or
      streams are included in “Revenue” (defined below) and are subject to the
      payment provisions of this Agreement; with prior written approval from
      Licensor, include the Content in audio and/or audiovisual compilation(s)
      for sale via physical distribution, and in such cases, to manufacture,
      make copies of, distribute, and sell physical embodiments of the Content;
      release, advertise, and sell electronic files or equivalent electronic
      form(s) of the Content and to permit others to do so under the trademark
      “BeatStars” or under any trademark used by Licensee; sub-license the
      rights granted by Licensor to Licensee in this Agreement as necessary to
      Licensee Partners, solely to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement
      including but not limited to those rights necessary to promote, market,
      advertise, distribute and sell the Content to consumers. Licensee’s grant
      of rights to Licensee Partners for use of the Content shall always be
      subject to the terms and limitations of this Agreement. 4) Promotional &
      Other Rights Unless otherwise instructed in writing by Licensor, Licensee
      shall have the non-exclusive right, in its sole discretion and in line
      with customary practices, to market the Masters and other Content as
      applicable, for promotional purposes and without compensation to Licensor.
      In order for Licensee to provide marketing and licensing services under
      this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee the right to: publicly perform
      the Masters (and other Content as applicable) on Licensee’s websites and
      permit Licensee Partners to publicly perform the Masters on their
      website(s) on a gratis basis for the purposes of promoting the sale of the
      Content. Licensor hereby acknowledges that Licensee and Licensee Partners
      shall be exempt from any payments of performance royalties otherwise due
      to owners of sound recordings for digital performances of the same if the
      use is for promotional purposes. Licensee shall require Licensee Partners
      to pay any public performance royalties which may be due to
      publishers/writers of the Compositions for promotional uses of the
      Compositions; include the Masters in one or more streaming electronic
      radio formats to promote and market the Masters; print, publish,
      disseminate, and otherwise use and permit others to use the “NIL
      Materials” (defined below) for the purposes of trade, advertising, and
      other exploitations solely in connection with the marketing, sale, and
      exploitation of the Content. The “NIL Materials” are defined as the
      approved likeness, approved biography, approved photos, and other approved
      promotional material provided by Licensor, including the name, both legal
      and professional, whether presently or hereafter used by Licensor, and
      name(s) of others whose work is embodied on the Content including the
      “Performer” (as defined below). All NIL Materials provided by Licensor to
      Licensee shall be deemed approved. All material provided by Licensor to
      Licensee may be edited to fit the format of the specific use without
      further approval from Licensor. Licensee shall have the right to permit
      Licensee Partners, successors and designees the right to use the approved
      NIL Materials as outlined in this subparagraph. “Performer(s)” as used in
      this Agreement means any person whose musical, vocal or production
      services are embodied on the Content. 5) Payment Licensee shall pay
      Licensor the percentages of “Revenue” as outlined on Revenue Shares in
      Appendix A of this Agreement and forming a part of it. “Revenue” means
      income actually received by or credited to Licensee that is derived solely
      from the exploitation of the Content less mechanical royalties, if any.
      Income received by Licensee may be subject to taxes, surcharges or fees
      imposed by government agencies or Licensee Partners before payment is sent
      to Licensee. Licensee shall have no obligation to pay Licensor Revenue
      which Licensee has not actually received until such time as Licensee
      receives such Revenue. In certain emerging digital media markets (“New
      Territories”), Licensee has entered into an agreement with one or more
      Licensee Partner(s) to manage the distribution and appropriate marketing
      of the Content in that specific New Territory. As such these particular
      Licensee Partners retain a higher percentage of the income from the
      distribution, marketing and sales of the Content than is typically
      maintained in developed digital media markets prior to paying Licensee.
      Licensor shall always have the option to withhold or withdraw Content from
      New Territories. Revenue shall be paid monthly on the 15th of each month
      or the following business day if such date occurs on a weekend or holiday.
      Each payment will be accompanied by a detailed statement showing all sales
      and other Revenue-generating exploitations of the Content. If Licensor has
      not received payment or a statement indicating that no payment is due by
      the 20th day of the month, Licensor shall promptly advise Licensee that
      Licensor has not received payment or a statement. Licensee shall
      investigate the situation and assure that payment and/or a statement are
      sent to Licensor. In no event shall Licensee be deemed in breach of its
      payment obligations under this Agreement if Licensor has not received
      payment or a statement on the 15th of the month. However, Licensee may be
      deemed in breach of its payment obligations if Licensee fails to make
      payments or provide a statement thirty (30) days after receiving notice
      from Licensor as outlined above. No payment shall be made to Licensor in
      any month when less than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) is due and
      payable to Licensor via paper check or Paypal. In the event payment is not
      made to Licensor for this reason, such amounts below one hundred fifty
      U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable, will accrue to Licensor’s account and
      shall be paid in the first month in which Licensor’s account reflects a
      balance greater than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable.
      All payments to Licensor from Licensee under this Agreement shall be made
      via paper check or Paypal. Licensor hereby acknowledges that in the United
      States among the ways that mechanical royalties for digital sales are
      customarily paid include: (i) payment directly to the publishers/writers
      by the music services/retailers, and (ii) an all-in payment as part of the
      fee paid by the music services/retailers to Licensee and are not paid
      separately to the publishers/writers of compositions. In those instances
      when Licensee receives what is considered the mechanical royalty as part
      of the fee from Licensee Partners, the portion deemed the mechanical
      payment shall be included in Revenue paid to Licensor. Licensor shall be
      fully and solely responsible for paying the mechanical royalty to the
      appropriate publishers/writers for use of the Compositions under this
      Agreement. 6) Accountings & Audits All statements shall be binding upon
      Licensor and not subject to objection by Licensor unless specific
      objection in writing, stating the basis thereof, is given to Licensee
      within two (2) years from the date the statement is rendered, viewed,
      and/or downloaded. Licensor shall have two (2) years from the date each
      statement is rendered, viewed and/or downloaded to conduct an inspection
      of Licensee’s books and records specifically relating to Licensor’s sales
      and payment activity. Such inspection shall take place at the location
      where Licensee normally keeps such books and records and shall be
      conducted during normal business hours. All such inspections shall be made
      upon prior written notice to Licensee at least thirty (30) days prior to
      the date Licensor intends to conduct such inspection. Licensor may only
      inspect records relating to each statement once and may only conduct such
      an inspection once a year. Licensee shall have the absolute right in
      accounting to Licensor to rely upon the statements received by Licensee
      from third parties and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for
      any error, omission, or other inaccuracy of any such statement(s) or
      information received by Licensee. However, if Licensee knows or has a
      reliable business reason to know of an error, omission or other inaccuracy
      in such third party statement or information, Licensee shall promptly act
      to correct it and when corrected, Licensee shall appropriately correct
      Licensor’s statement and Revenue. 7) Confidentiality Licensee and Licensor
      shall keep the terms and conditions of this Agreement confidential both
      during the Term and thereafter, and shall not disclose any information
      concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement to any other person
      or entity. Each party may refer generally to the existence of this
      Agreement but shall not reveal the terms of this Agreement, including but
      not limited to the payment provisions, other confidential information,
      proprietary information, business plans, business models, customers,
      clients, technology, products, or any other information which either party
      identifies as confidential (collectively, the “Confidential Information”)
      without the prior written consent of the other party. Either party may
      disclose the Confidential Information on a “need to know” basis to its
      attorneys, financial, and other advisors who are under a duty of
      confidentiality to the disclosing party without the prior written consent
      of the other party so long as those agents are informed of this
      Confidentiality provision and agree to be bound by it and maintain the
      Confidential Information confidential. If required by law or governmental
      regulation, either party may disclose the Confidential Information only
      after it provides the other party with notice of the potential disclosure
      and the other party has the opportunity to narrow the information to be
      disclosed or dispute the disclosure. Nothing in this provision shall
      prohibit either party from disclosing that an agreement exists between
      Licensor and Licensee so long as the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement are not disclosed. 8) Representations and Warranties A.
      Licensor’s representations and warranties. Licensor warrants, represents,
      and agrees that: unless otherwise noted, Licensor possesses all rights in

      Agreement; Licensor has the full right, power, and authority to enter into
      and fully perform this Agreement and all of Licensor’s obligations under
      this Agreement and to grant Licensee the rights granted in this Agreement.
      Licensor has not granted and will not grant or attempt to grant to any
      other person, firm, corporation or entity, rights of any kind which are
      inconsistent with the grant of rights to Licensee or which would in any
      way impair the rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement during the
      Term. Licensor explicitly warrants and represents that: the Content
      contains NO unauthorized “Samples.” “Samples” as used herein means any
      portion(s) or interpolation(s) of third party master recording(s) and/or
      composition(s), video(s) and/or other material(s), or portions thereof
      whether musical, lyrical or otherwise, not owned and/or controlled by
      Licensor. Licensor explicitly warrants and represents that the Content,
      the sale, distribution, and exploitation of the Content, or any uses of
      the Content contemplated herein shall not violate any law or infringe upon
      any common law or statutory rights of any person, corporation, or entity,
      including without limitation contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks,
      and rights of privacy or publicity; as required for use of the
      Compositions contemplated under this Agreement, except for those
      Compositions subject to paragraph 5 above, Licensor has obtained
      mechanical licenses for all Compositions and that Licensor shall
      administer and pay all mechanical royalty payments to the
      publishers/writers of the Compositions. Licensor shall make any and all
      payments, which may be due to artists, producers, musicians, Performers,
      writers and publishers when not otherwise addressed in this Agreement and
      all others whose work and/or performances are embodied on the Content
      and/or all artwork submitted by Licensor. B. Licensee representations and
      warranties. Licensee warrants, represents, and agrees that: Licensee has
      the right, power, and authority to enter into and fully perform this
      Agreement and all of its obligations under this Agreement; Licensee shall,
      at its sole cost and expense, encode and deliver the Content to Licensee
      Partners. 9) Indemnification Each party (the “Indemnifying Party”) will
      indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates,
      their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (“Indemnified
      Party”) from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
      obligations, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees)
      which result from or arise in connection with or are related in any way to
      a breach by the Indemnifying Party of any of its representations and
      warranties in this Agreement. If a third party asserts a claim or
      allegation which, if proven, would constitute a breach by the Indemnifying
      Party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants and or
      obligations under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
      notify the Indemnifying Party in writing. The Indemnifying Party shall
      have the right at its own expense to participate in the defense thereof
      with counsel of its own choosing, provided however that the Indemnified
      Party’s decision in connection with the defense or settlement of any such
      claim or demand shall be final. No Indemnified Party shall effect any
      settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding with respect to which
      indemnity could have been sought under this Agreement by the Indemnified
      Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.
      Licensor shall indemnify Licensee, its officers, directors, employees, and
      agents from and against all third party claims, actions or demands against
      Licensee for use of the Content as granted in this Agreement which may
      constitute infringement of copyright and/or trademark, and violate rights
      of privacy and/or publicity. Licensor explicitly indemnifies Licensee from
      and against any and all actions, demands, or claims brought against
      Licensee for non-payment or insufficient payment of mechanical royalties.
      10) Termination After the Initial Term, Licensor may terminate this
      Agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice to Licensee and Licensee
      must confirm in writing receipt of such notice. Upon termination or
      expiration of this Agreement, the rights granted to Licensee hereunder
      shall automatically revert to Licensor. Additionally, Licensor may, upon

      respect to any particular Master, Composition or Additional Work without
      effecting this Agreement for the remaining Masters, Compositions and/or
      Additional Works. After the Initial Term, Licensee has the right to
      terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice to the
