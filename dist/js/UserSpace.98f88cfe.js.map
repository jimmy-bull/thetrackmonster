The\n            genre is created by the Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and leader\n            Fela Kuti, who gives it the name.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"mt-3 blog_para\">\n            It was Kuti who first used the term Afrobeat after returning from a\n            tour. America with its group Nigeria '70 (formerly Koola Lobitos).\n          </p>\n\n          <p class=\"mt-3 blog_para\">\n            The origins of Afrobeat date back to the early 1920s in Ghana. At\n            this time, the Ghanaian musicians incorporate foreign influences\n            such as foxtrot and calypso into Ghanaian rhythms like Osibisaba\n            (Fante).\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"mt-5 blog_para\">\n            Under the influence of its creator Fela Kuti, to the innovative\n            rhythm created by his drummer Tony Allen and to the quality of his\n            compositions, or he sings engaged and satirical texts, this music\n            becomes quickly very popular in Nigeria. It is different from other\n            popular Nigerian styles like Juju, Apala or Fuji music. Kuti invents\n            the term afrobeat, and forms musical forges. Afrobeat, music with an\n            irresistible rhythm, based on a few chords played in a loop by\n            guitars and keyboards, embellished with powerful and melodic brass\n            riffs, is intimately linked to the political and urban context in\n            which it was created.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"mt-3 blog_para\">\n            It also contains a form of protest against the stranglehold of\n            corrupt politicians, the nepotism of the established oligarchy,\n            evokes Nigeria and its wealth, contempt of the population, and a\n            desire for social change. Fela Kuti records a large number of high\n            quality records, mostly reissued by Universal in the 2000s.\n          </p>\n          <div class=\"text-center\">\n            <h2 class=\"classic_main_blog_title mt-5\">\n              New Generation Afro Beat Artist\n            </h2>\n            <div id=\"demo\" class=\"carousel slide mt-5\" data-ride=\"carousel\">\n              <!-- Indicators -->\n              <ul class=\"carousel-indicators\">\n                <li data-target=\"#demo\" data-slide-to=\"0\" class=\"active\"></li>\n                <li data-target=\"#demo\" data-slide-to=\"1\"></li>\n                <li data-target=\"#demo\" data-slide-to=\"2\"></li>\n              </ul>\n\n              <!-- The slideshow -->\n              <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\n                <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\n                  <img\n                    src=\"https://www.musicinafrica.net/sites/default/files/images/article/202102/emokuscw4aatxya1.jpeg\"\n                    class=\"col-lg-12\"\n                    alt=\"Los Angeles\"\n                  />\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\n                    <h3>Davido</h3>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n                  <img\n                    src=\"https://pan-african-music.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/92874306-wizkid.jpg\"\n                    class=\"col-lg-12\"\n                    alt=\"Chicago\"\n                  />\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\n                    <h3>WizKid</h3>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n                  <img\n                    src=\"https://www.courrierinternational.com/sites/ci_master/files/styles/image_940/public/illustrations/thumbnails/nigerian-musician-adv-09-1.jpg?itok=pEpRUZRJ\"\n                    class=\"col-lg-12\"\n                    alt=\"New York\"\n                  />\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\n                    <h3>Burna Boy</h3>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n\n              <!-- Left and right controls -->\n              <a class=\"carousel-control-prev\" href=\"#demo\" data-slide=\"prev\">\n                <span class=\"carousel-control-prev-icon\"></span>\n              </a>\n              <a class=\"carousel-control-next\" href=\"#demo\" data-slide=\"next\">\n                <span class=\"carousel-control-next-icon\"></span>\n              </a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <p class=\"mt-5 blog_para\">\n            Most of today's Afrobeat start-ups, now in their twenties, grew up\n            in circumstances and influences different from those of Nigerian\n            instrumental pioneers like Fela.

It is defined by its dark, violent, nihilistic\n            lyrical content and its rhythms influenced by the trap.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"mt-3 blog_para\">\n            The Drill made its mark in the United States in mid-2012 following\n            the success of rappers and producers like Young Chop, Chief Keef,\n            Lil Durk, King Louie, Fredo Santana and Lil Reese who had many local\n            fans and a significant internet presence. The attention of media and\n            the signing of drill musicians on major labels followed.

In this Agreement, the\n            Masters and the Compositions and the Additional Works, if any, are\n            collectively referred to as the “Content.”\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </ol>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      Licensor hereby licenses the Content to Licensee for distribution and\n      exploitation as follows: The non-exclusive electronic, digital, and mobile\n      rights in the Content to create digital and/or electronic copies and\n      compilations, to distribute, to sell, and to publicly perform the Content\n      via all electronic, digital, and mobile platforms owned and/or controlled\n      by third parties with whom Licensee has or enters into agreements with\n      during the Term (“Licensee Partners”). Licensor will have an online\n      account with Licensee known as the “Dashboard.” The Dashboard enables\n      Licensor to see its activities with Licensee Partners. The right to:\n      perform the Content in streaming format on Licensee’s website or other\n      websites owned and/or controlled by Licensee Partners; publicly display\n      and make available for download as part of the sale of the Masters, the\n      lyrics of the Compositions; collect monies for the playing of the Masters\n      on non-interactive webcasts and streaming of the Masters (payable by\n      SoundExchange in the USA).

Licensee’s grant\n      of rights to Licensee Partners for use of the Content shall always be\n      subject to the terms and limitations of this Agreement. 4) Promotional &\n      Other Rights Unless otherwise instructed in writing by Licensor, Licensee\n      shall have the non-exclusive right, in its sole discretion and in line\n      with customary practices, to market the Masters and other Content as\n      applicable, for promotional purposes and without compensation to Licensor.\n      In order for Licensee to provide marketing and licensing services under\n      this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee the right to: publicly perform\n      the Masters (and other Content as applicable) on Licensee’s websites and\n      permit Licensee Partners to publicly perform the Masters on their\n      website(s) on a gratis basis for the purposes of promoting the sale of the\n      Content. Licensor hereby acknowledges that Licensee and Licensee Partners\n      shall be exempt from any payments of performance royalties otherwise due\n      to owners of sound recordings for digital performances of the same if the\n      use is for promotional purposes. Licensee shall require Licensee Partners\n      to pay any public performance royalties which may be due to\n      publishers/writers of the Compositions for promotional uses of the\n      Compositions; include the Masters in one or more streaming electronic\n      radio formats to promote and market the Masters; print, publish,\n      disseminate, and otherwise use and permit others to use the “NIL\n      Materials” (defined below) for the purposes of trade, advertising, and\n      other exploitations solely in connection with the marketing, sale, and\n      exploitation of the Content. The “NIL Materials” are defined as the\n      approved likeness, approved biography, approved photos, and other approved\n      promotional material provided by Licensor, including the name, both legal\n      and professional, whether presently or hereafter used by Licensor, and\n      name(s) of others whose work is embodied on the Content including the\n      “Performer” (as defined below). All NIL Materials provided by Licensor to\n      Licensee shall be deemed approved. All material provided by Licensor to\n      Licensee may be edited to fit the format of the specific use without\n      further approval from Licensor. Licensee shall have the right to permit\n      Licensee Partners, successors and designees the right to use the approved\n      NIL Materials as outlined in this subparagraph. “Performer(s)” as used in\n      this Agreement means any person whose musical, vocal or production\n      services are embodied on the Content. 5) Payment Licensee shall pay\n      Licensor the percentages of “Revenue” as outlined on Revenue Shares in\n      Appendix A of this Agreement and forming a part of it. “Revenue” means\n      income actually received by or credited to Licensee that is derived solely\n      from the exploitation of the Content less mechanical royalties, if any.\n      Income received by Licensee may be subject to taxes, surcharges or fees\n      imposed by government agencies or Licensee Partners before payment is sent\n      to Licensee. Licensee shall have no obligation to pay Licensor Revenue\n      which Licensee has not actually received until such time as Licensee\n      receives such Revenue. In certain emerging digital media markets (“New\n      Territories”), Licensee has entered into an agreement with one or more\n      Licensee Partner(s) to manage the distribution and appropriate marketing\n      of the Content in that specific New Territory. As such these particular\n      Licensee Partners retain a higher percentage of the income from the\n      distribution, marketing and sales of the Content than is typically\n      maintained in developed digital media markets prior to paying Licensee.\n      Licensor shall always have the option to withhold or withdraw Content from\n      New Territories. Revenue shall be paid monthly on the 15th of each month\n      or the following business day if such date occurs on a weekend or holiday.\n      Each payment will be accompanied by a detailed statement showing all sales\n      and other Revenue-generating exploitations of the Content. If Licensor has\n      not received payment or a statement indicating that no payment is due by\n      the 20th day of the month, Licensor shall promptly advise Licensee that\n      Licensor has not received payment or a statement. Licensee shall\n      investigate the situation and assure that payment and/or a statement are\n      sent to Licensor. In no event shall Licensee be deemed in breach of its\n      payment obligations under this Agreement if Licensor has not received\n      payment or a statement on the 15th of the month. However, Licensee may be\n      deemed in breach of its payment obligations if Licensee fails to make\n      payments or provide a statement thirty (30) days after receiving notice\n      from Licensor as outlined above. No payment shall be made to Licensor in\n      any month when less than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) is due and\n      payable to Licensor via paper check or Paypal. In the event payment is not\n      made to Licensor for this reason, such amounts below one hundred fifty\n      U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable, will accrue to Licensor’s account and\n      shall be paid in the first month in which Licensor’s account reflects a\n      balance greater than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable.\n      All payments to Licensor from Licensee under this Agreement shall be made\n      via paper check or Paypal. Licensor hereby acknowledges that in the United\n      States among the ways that mechanical royalties for digital sales are\n      customarily paid include: (i) payment directly to the publishers/writers\n      by the music services/retailers, and (ii) an all-in payment as part of the\n      fee paid by the music services/retailers to Licensee and are not paid\n      separately to the publishers/writers of compositions. In those instances\n      when Licensee receives what is considered the mechanical royalty as part\n      of the fee from Licensee Partners, the portion deemed the mechanical\n      payment shall be included in Revenue paid to Licensor. Licensor shall be\n      fully and solely responsible for paying the mechanical royalty to the\n      appropriate publishers/writers for use of the Compositions under this\n      Agreement. 6) Accountings & Audits All statements shall be binding upon\n      Licensor and not subject to objection by Licensor unless specific\n      objection in writing, stating the basis thereof, is given to Licensee\n      within two (2) years from the date the statement is rendered, viewed,\n      and/or downloaded. Licensor shall have two (2) years from the date each\n      statement is rendered, viewed and/or downloaded to conduct an inspection\n      of Licensee’s books and records specifically relating to Licensor’s sales\n      and payment activity. Such inspection shall take place at the location\n      where Licensee normally keeps such books and records and shall be\n      conducted during normal business hours. All such inspections shall be made\n      upon prior written notice to Licensee at least thirty (30) days prior to\n      the date Licensor intends to conduct such inspection. Licensor may only\n      inspect records relating to each statement once and may only conduct such\n      an inspection once a year. Licensee shall have the absolute right in\n      accounting to Licensor to rely upon the statements received by Licensee\n      from third parties and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for\n      any error, omission, or other inaccuracy of any such statement(s) or\n      information received by Licensee. However, if Licensee knows or has a\n      reliable business reason to know of an error, omission or other inaccuracy\n      in such third party statement or information, Licensee shall promptly act\n      to correct it and when corrected, Licensee shall appropriately correct\n      Licensor’s statement and Revenue. 7) Confidentiality Licensee and Licensor\n      shall keep the terms and conditions of this Agreement confidential both\n      during the Term and thereafter, and shall not disclose any information\n      concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement to any other person\n      or entity. Each party may refer generally to the existence of this\n      Agreement but shall not reveal the terms of this Agreement, including but\n      not limited to the payment provisions, other confidential information,\n      proprietary information, business plans, business models, customers,\n      clients, technology, products, or any other information which either party\n      identifies as confidential (collectively, the “Confidential Information”)\n      without the prior written consent of the other party. Either party may\n      disclose the Confidential Information on a “need to know” basis to its\n      attorneys, financial, and other advisors who are under a duty of\n      confidentiality to the disclosing party without the prior written consent\n      of the other party so long as those agents are informed of this\n      Confidentiality provision and agree to be bound by it and maintain the\n      Confidential Information confidential. If required by law or governmental\n      regulation, either party may disclose the Confidential Information only\n      after it provides the other party with notice of the potential disclosure\n      and the other party has the opportunity to narrow the information to be\n      disclosed or dispute the disclosure. Nothing in this provision shall\n      prohibit either party from disclosing that an agreement exists between\n      Licensor and Licensee so long as the terms and conditions of this\n      Agreement are not disclosed. 8) Representations and Warranties A.\n      Licensor’s representations and warranties.
